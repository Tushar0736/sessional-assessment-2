            <p>In the picture is the common phrase to use when talking about the people or things shown when a photograph is taken. If someone or something is in a picture the picture shows that person or thing. It is a picture of that person or thing. If something is on a picture it is touching the picture. The picture itself is not showing that thing.</p>

                            different picture. It is an extract from another book by Gerald Durrell
                            called My Family and Other Animals. In the passage he describes the
                            appearance of a villa in which he and his family lived when he was a child
                            growing up on the Greek island of Corfu. </h3>

                            By contrast, the original picture of the infamous dress confirmed that the answer was, in fact, black and blue, and the Laurel and Yanny audio clip was playing a recording of both names at the same time, so both answers were technically correct.</h3>

                            In the end, deciding whether to put your photo on a resume is a symbol of larger issues that you need to figure out for yourself, rather than delegating out to know-it-alls like myself.
                            
                            Let’s look at some advice that seems to typify the “no photo” rule for resumes.  One prominent columnist wrote last year that, if you use a photo, you’ll come across as “naïve and unprofessional.”</h3>

Uncertainty and social distancing changed people's behaviors, impacting on their feelings, daily habits, and social relationships, which are core elements in human well-being. In particular, restrictions due to the quarantine increased feelings of loneliness and anxiety. Within this context, the use of digital technologies has been recommended to relieve stress and anxiety and to decrease loneliness, even though the overall effects of social media consumption during pandemics still need to be carefully addressed. In this regard, social media use evidence risk and opportunities.</h3>

                            Imagine shining a flashlight at a globe. Only part of it would receive light. The opposite side would be dark. As Earth rotates, different parts of Earth receive sunlight or darkness, giving us day and night. As your location on Earth rotates into sunlight, you see the sun rise. When your location rotates out of sunlight, you see the sun set.</h3>

I therefore adopt an analogue approach to a digital practice. From the moment I began thinking about my current project I knew it had to be in black and white and created with a medium format digital camera and that is what I am using. I will not change from that process.

                            I am aware of many photographers who do not follow the same strict approach to such decision making. Digital allows us to make images in colour or black and white but as we all know it also allows us to transform colour images into black and white in post production. The temptation therefore to ‘cover all bases’ by making images in colour knowing that they can always be converted into black and white is strong for those unsure or undecided on how they want the finished artefact to appear.\</h3>
